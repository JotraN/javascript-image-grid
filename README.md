<h1>Description</h1>
Easily create a grid of images using javascript with jquery, html, and css based upon the number of rows you want to use.<br>
The example provided assumes the aspect ratio of each image is 1:1, that is the width and height are the same values.<br>
It uses a canvas to draw the images as the canvas can crop images easily.<br>
Multiple divs are then added for each image to allow interaction with each image.
<h1>Example</h1>
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JotraN/javascript-image-grid/master/example.png"><img src="example.png" alt="Example" width="200px"/></a>
<h2>DISCLAIMER:</h2> 
You can use this for whatever.
<h1>Installation Instructions</h1>
Download the neccesary files (index.html, script.js, stylesheet.css).<br>
Fill the items array with your images.<br>
The example provided assumes each image is part of a bigger Item object to allow for more user interaction (therefore an Item class is provided).<br>
Make any other adjustments at your own will (i.e. number of rows used).
